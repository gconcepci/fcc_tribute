        <h3>Most Under-rated band of all time</h3>
        <p>The Minutemen were one of those groups that once you hear them for the first
        time, it changes you forever. This trio, comprised of D Boon on electric guitar/vocals,
        Mike Watt on bass and George Hurley on drums, was a powerhouse of inventive funky riffs 
        delivered with the speed and intensity of hardcore punk. They were the epitome of the punk diy 
        ethos displayed by other bands on the SST label back in the 80's.
        The group released multiple EP's and albums during their short run from 1980-1985. One of their defining 
        trademarks is that most of their songs rarely hit the 2 minute mark. Paranoid Time is an EP with 8 songs
        and has a 6 minute run time! Before the band ended due to the untimely death of D Boon in 1985, the group 
        released one of the greatest albums of all time, Double Nickels on the Dime, a 44 track masterpiece that
        perfectly encapsulates the band at their peak. It is in my opinion, required listening.
        Give them a listen and remember, this band can be your life.
